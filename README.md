# Random Quote Generator

To inspire you on your coding journey!

**Purpose:**
    This project was created to demonstrate foundational concepts in Javascript functions, arrays, and objects. I create an array of objects that stored the quotes, source and additional information (citation and/or year). This is the final project for Unit 1 of the Treehouse Techdegree. 

**How to use:**
    Click *"Show another quote"* button to display a random quote.

**Why I chose this project:**
    I am decided to choose quotes from black women in history. I hope these quotes can inspires others and we move into our tech journey.

**Challenges:**
    The most difficult part of this project was the printQuote function that displays a new quote each time a user clicks a button. I was able to learn more about how to build upon strings, and properly display it to the page. 
    Not all of the quotes had a corresponding citation or year, so I had to think about how to display this information on the page alongside the quote and source. It was challenging had to incorporate decision making into my program using conditionals.

**Future Considerations:**
    I hope in the future to add extra features, for examples, pictures, object tags, random background colors, and auto-refeshing the the page. I want to learn more about how to enable the buttons functionality.
