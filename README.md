# Random Quote Generator

Breaking it down

1. How do I generate a random number?

2. How do I use that random number to get a quote object from the quotes array?

ideas-
randomly select a quote from the array and then return it
    function getRandomQuote() {

        // Code to get quote from array
    }



call getRandomQuote and then print it    
function printQuote(){

        // Code to print the quote using fron project instructions
    }

Comments in code about what it is doing and how it works.
