# Random Quote Generator

This project was created to demonstrate foundational concepts in Javascript functions, arrays, and objects. This is the end of unit 1 project by the Treehouse Techdegree. I am currently in a place in my life where I am reconnecting with my roots. 

So, I am decided to choose quotes from black women in history. I hope these quotes can inspires others and we move into our tech journey.

This most difficult part of this project was the printQuote function where I was instructed to display a new quote each time a user clicks a button. I was able to learn more about how to build upon strings and seeing how I can incorporate decision making into my program using conditionals. I want to learn more about how to enable the buttons functionality. 

I hope in the future to add extra features, for examples, pictures, object tags, random background colors, and auto-refeshing tho the page.
